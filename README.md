GoFAST Project 


--- Objective ---

1. Build a web application through which a user can get the fastest route 
	 from their current location to destination. 

2. Build a basic web application using Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and Ruby. 

3. Use development tools (JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS) to improve user experience

4. Use Google Maps API, Bart API, and Uber API to improve user experience


--- Summary ---

My main goal of this project is to get used to basic framework of development. 
Rebuilding the same web application using Rails is a short term goal. I used Google Maps Direction API
to render the map and to get distance and duration.
